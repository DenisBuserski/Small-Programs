### Ceasar Cipher
In cryptography, the Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. To learn more about it check - [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). My version of the Caesar cipher takes as an input the word you want to encrypt and a number by which, we will move the letters. If the new position points to a number bigger than the alphabet size, the counter starts from the begging.

Example:
- Input: abcd
- Number: 3
- Output: defg
- Explanation: 

- Input: zzzywx
- Number: 4
- Output: dddcab
- Explanation:
