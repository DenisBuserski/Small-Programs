### Ceasar Cipher
In cryptography, the Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. To learn more about it check - [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). My version of the Caesar cipher takes as an input the word you want to encrypt and a number by which, we will move the letters. If the new position points to a number bigger than the alphabet size, the counter starts from the begging.

Example 1:
- Input: abcd
- Number: 3
- Output: defg
- Explanation: The first letter "a" is at position 1. When we sum 1 + 3 = 4, and "d" is the 4th letter in the english alphabet. The same applies to "b" -> 2 + 3 = 5 -> "3"; "c" -> 3 + 3 = 6 -> "f"; "d" -> 4 + 3 = 7 -> "g"

Example 2:
- Input: zzzywx
- Number: 4
- Output: dddcab
- Explanation:
